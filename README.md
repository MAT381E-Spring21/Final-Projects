The main aim of developing a project is to find an open-source data related to the topics mentioned above and then to use basic data science tools (data importing, cleaning, re-shaping, exploring, and visualization techniques) to touch one of societal problems in our world and let their voice be heard. 

Here is the teams and their project outputs:
