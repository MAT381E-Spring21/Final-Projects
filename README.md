In MAT381E:Introduction to Data Science course, students, as a group of 2-3, are expected to develop a data science project motivated by one of the topics related to, but not limited to:

* Animals,
* Children, 
* Clean energy,
* Clean water,
* Climate,
* Education,
* Food security,
* Gender equality,
* Good health and well-being,
* Hunger,
* Poverty,
* Sustainable & accessible cities and communities,
* Responsible consumption & production,
* Reduced inequalities & refugees,
* Peace & justice & human rights, and
* People with disabilities.

Some of these topics are also within the scope of sustainable development goals of United Nations for a better future for our world (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). 

The main aim of developing a project is to find an open-source data related to the topics mentioned above and then to use basic data science tools (data importing, cleaning, re-shaping, exploring, and visualization techniques) to touch one of societal problems in our world and let their voice be heard.
